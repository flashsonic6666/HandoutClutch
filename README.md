# HandoutClutch

Welcome to HandoutClutch!

Currently, there are two different types of instruction provided- Handouts and Practice Tests.

## Handouts

A Handout is just a compilation of problems in a certain topic that I believe would be beneficial to complete. Depending on the topic, there may also be some instruction provided in it.

Each problem in a Handout has a specific amount of points attatched to it. You must complete a certain amount of points in order to be "completed" with it. You must also answer each of the required problems, which are labeled for your convenience.

### Handout Interface

To use/access a Handout, start on the main page, where you will find a table with all of the available Handouts. They are each labeled with a name and its subject in parentheses, for exmaple, Triangles (G) for Geometry. You will also be able to see your progress on each, which is updated automatically for you. You can click on the link for a specific Handout in the table to get to a page that will direct you to a PDF version of a Handout and a place where you can submit your answers.

In the submission page, you will notice two main parts to the submission page: A table in the top right, and an image that displays the current problem in the center of the screen. The table in the top right indicates which problems you have yet to complete, as well as the number of points you have left. The required problems are also highlighted in purple, so you know whether or not you have completed all of them. The image in the center shows the problem that is currently being focused. You can change the image that is being shown by clicking the arrows (which cycles through the problems) or entering the problem number you want to go to in a box in the top, in case you don't want to scroll through a ton of problems to get from problem 1 to problem 25. You will also see a submission box for checking you answer below the problem. Note that whatever problem is currently being displayed is the question that you should be answering, putting in the correct answer for problem 24 when problem 25 is being focused will not work. You will be notified whether your answer is correct or incorrect, and the number of points you have will go up. You will continually do this until you have reached the required amount of points, upon which you can go to another handout or keep on practicing more of the problems, if you really want :)

## Practice Tests

These are fairly self explanatory. Each is going to be an online AMC12, multiple choice, 60-minute practice test. You will enter your answers in online, and the system will autograde and display your score when you are finished. The 60-minutes is to help you work better under time pressure, and the online entry is meant to simulate that of the 2021 AMC10/12, which will be online.

### Practice Test Interface

To access a pratice test, start on the main page, where you will again, see a table with all of the currently available practice tests. They are labeled by name, and will display your score (if completed), as well as the current test status (not started, in progress, completed). The scores on the main page will automatically be updated when you complete a test. 

After clicking on one of the links in the table to access a practice test, you will be sent to a page that will give you some extra details about how the test will function. From here, you can either choose to begin the test or access your results (in case you have already finished the test and wish to review your results).

On the results page, you will be able to see your score, the AIME cutoff for that year, as well as the number of skipped/incorrect/correct questions. You will also be able to see which questions you missed. The correct answer for each question is displayed behind a hide tag, in case you do not want to spoil the questions for yourself. Note that the results page will be empty if you have not completed the test.

## And that's it!

I'm thinking about adding more stuff, like "Zen Mode", which just gives you certain questions that you didn't answer from the handouts, or missed in the practice tests, but that's still a work in progress. And as always, if you find any bugs or have any features you want added, just either add it to the list of greviances or come to my room and yell at me if I'm not currently doing something, although I have like a 20% chance of listening to you. ;))
