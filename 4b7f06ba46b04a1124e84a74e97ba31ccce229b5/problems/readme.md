# Creating New Handouts

Just so that you don't forget how to do this.

## Handout Creation

After you have finished compiling your problems in overleaf (and adding any desired instructional comments), make sure you assign each problem a point value and label the required problems. Also make sure that you change the title name. From there, take an individual picture of each photo and call it something along the lines of "abcProblemx", where "abc" is the three digit code for the specific handout (usually first 3 letters of the topic), and x is the problem number.

## The /problems folder

Now create a new folder in the /problems directory and add three things: answers, home.md, and the pictures of the problems.
In answers just put the answers to the problems.
In home.md, which basically just gives the user the links to the submission page and the handout, you can just copy paste the home.md from a previous unit and change the title, links, and limerick.
And you can upload the pictures directly from your computer (the ones you just took of the problem).

## handouts folder

Also be sure to upload the handout to the handouts folder, and give it a title of "abc.pdf", where abc is the three letter code.

## pointTable.html

Finally, go to pointTable.html and add in all the necessary information. This includes but is likely not limited to:
Required problems to requiredProblems
The number related to your three letter code (e.g. "exp"=0, "pol"=1)
The name of folder to folderName
The three letter code to handoutCode
The answers to each question of the handout, in order, to answers
The name you want to show up in the table of the handout to handoutName

## And that should be it!
