## Important Stuff

Once you start the test, DO NOT CLOSE OUT OF THE PAGE.

Please only put in answers of "A","B","C","D","E","a","b","c","d","e" or "" (don't put the quotes, obviously) in the answer blank. Any other answer will not be accepted.

Do not include spaces in any part of your answer, or it will be counted wrong.

As mentioned above, upper/lower case does not matter.

There is no time warning, and the timer is a tiny thing at the top of the screen. I'll pretend like this is to help you time manage on tests and not because I'm lazy 8)

The test will auto-submit even if you don't hit the submit button, just like it will on AoPS, so no need to worry about that.

Good Luck! :D
